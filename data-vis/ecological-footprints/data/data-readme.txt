The data were downloaded from Global Footprint Network's website:
http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/licenses1/

They have also been featured in World Wildlife Fund reports, e.g., the
Living Planet Report (2015).

"NFA 2015 Public Data Package.xlsx" has the original data. Cleaned
data are in "gfn-cleaned.csv". Variable conversions are
self-explanatory with the exception of the following: 

[Cropland Footprint, Grazing Footprint, Forest Product Footprint,
Carbon Footprint, Fish Footprint, Built up land]

---> [cropland, grazing, forestprod, carbon, fish, builtupland]

These new variables were standardized to add up to one, so that each
can be viewed as the proportion contributed to the outcome of interest
(earths required).
